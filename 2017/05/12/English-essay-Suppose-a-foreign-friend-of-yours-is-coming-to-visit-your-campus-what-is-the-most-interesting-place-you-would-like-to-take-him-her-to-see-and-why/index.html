<p>If a foreign friend is coming to visit our campus, the most interesting place I’d like to take him to see is the school art gallery. There are many exhibitions held here periodically, including calligraphy, painting, photography and sculpture, etc. Most of the exhibits are created by our university students, but sometimes, there are authentic works of well-known artists, like the famous painting <em>Shrimp</em> by Qibaishi.<br>The reason why I take him to the school art gallery is that I hope he can know more about the campus life of Chinese university students. I’d like him to know that our campus life is not confined to study. On the contrary, our campus life is rich and colorful. In addition, compared with other places, school art gallery is more representative, because it collects excellent works of our university students and it shows our intelligence and wisdom intensively.</p>

<p>To start with, Central Avenue is a symbol of Harbin, which has a long history. There are European-style buildings in mounting numbers along the street, attracting a great many tourists to take photos with them. Moreover, a variety of delicious foods are tempting. Taking a look around, I can find examples too numerous to list. The best illustration might be ice-cream brick of Ma Dieer. Finally, brilliant historic culture can widen vision and enhance knowledge, laying a solid foundation for the understanding of this fabulous city.</p>
<p>Harbin is a city full of vitality and energy. I believe my foreign friend will enjoy her days here. Not only can she appreciate the landscape of the Songhua River but also taste authentic northeast food. No better place can be chosen than Central Avenue!</p>

<p>If I’m the guide of my foreign friend’s visit to our campus, I will choose the Cherry Avenue as our first destination.</p>
<p>As the name implies, the Cherry Avenue is lined with hundreds of neatly-placed cherry blossom trees. It is about 200 meters long and a major scenic spot in our campus. In spring when the cherry trees bloom, the flowers are so dense that looking from a distance, it seems as if the road were surrounded by pink-hued clouds. Especially when there is a breeze, petals of cherry blossoms flutter and fall gently like a drizzle. Such breath-taking scene will put visitors into a kind of trance.What’s more special is the buildings along the avenue. Built in early 1900s, they are now called “cherry blossom castle”. They’ve witnessed the history of our school and even our country. You can learn a lot about our school there.</p>
<p>In a word, a tour to the Cherry Avenue is both an amazing sight-seeing and a great opportunity to know about the culture of our school.</p>

<p>Overlooking the Li Jiang River, Guilin is located in the northeast of Guangxi. The name was derived from the cassia trees of the location. The trees line the streets of the town with yellow flowers blossoming every September, filling the air with sweet scent.</p>
<p>Guilin is a place of breath-taking scenery. From ancient times, Guilin has been noted for its elegant landscape. It features beautiful mountains, clear rivers, grotesque rocks and mystic crags, which is a feast for the eyes. Sitting on a bamboo raft drifting down the river, visitors can see the varied shapes of the pinnacles reflected in the water. They will feel as if they were in a scroll of Chinese landscape painting.I believe that my foreign friend will marvel at the unparalleled beauty of Guilin.</p>
